#'Mousedata: A data set about a diet induced obesity mouse study
#'
#'The Mousedata is an analyze data used to evaluate leves of urinary PGE-M and and PGD-M in obese vs. lean mice +/- celecoxib.
#'
#'@section Background:
#'
#'In a previous study by the investigator, levels of urinary PGE-M, an inflammation biomarker, were increased in association with obesity. COX-2, an enzyme in the related inflammation pathway,
#'is elevated in inflamed adipose tissue in association with obesity. To test the hypothesis that COX-2 is directly responsible for the elevation in urinary PGE-M in obesity, Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor was utilized in a mouse model of obesity. Mice were randomized into four groups as shown below:
#'
#'1. Low fat 10\% diet, sham OVX
#'
#'2. Low fat 10\% diet, sham OVX + celecoxib in diet
#'
#'3. High fat 60\% diet, OVX
#'
#'4. High fat 60\% diet, OVX + celecoxib in diet
#'
#'
#' @details Following 9 days on control or celecoxib containing diets, mice were placed into metabolic cages (3-4 mice per cage) and urine was collected for up to 48 hours. 5 to 6 samples of urine from each of the four groups for a total of 23 samples were analyzed to quantify levels of urinary PGE-M and PGD-M along with
#' associated creatinine levels in each sample.
